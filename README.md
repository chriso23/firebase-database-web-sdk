Firebase Realtime Database Web Quickstart
-----------------------------------------
The Firebase Realtime Database lets you store and sync data between users and devices in real-time by using a cloud-hosted, NoSQL database. All updated data syncs across connected client devices in milliseconds, and data remains available if your app goes offline, which provides a great user experience regardless of network connectivity.

Introduction
------------
This quickstart sample app contains a step-by-step guide that demonstrates how to connect your web application to Firebase, set up the Firebase Realtime Database Web SDK, and configure the database rules to build a simple blogging application that allows authorized users to post and retrieve data in real-time.
